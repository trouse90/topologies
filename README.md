# Network Topologies Project

## Overview

This project provides a simple explanation and accompanying diagrams of different network topologies. It aims to help users understand the basic structures and layouts of various network configurations used in networking.

## Topologies Covered

1. **Bus Topology**
   - Explanation: A single central cable, known as the bus, to which all network devices are connected.
   - Diagram: ![Bus Topology](diagrams/bus_topology.png)

2. **Star Topology**
   - Explanation: All devices are connected to a central hub or switch. The hub acts as a repeater for data flow.

3. **Ring Topology**
   - Explanation: Each device is connected to two other devices, forming a circular data path.

4. **Mesh Topology**
   - Explanation: Devices are interconnected with many redundant interconnections between network nodes.

5. **Tree Topology**
   - Explanation: A hybrid topology combining characteristics of star and bus topologies. Devices are arranged in a hierarchical manner.
   - Diagram: ![Tree Topology](diagrams/tree_topology.png)

6. **Hybrid Topology**
   - Explanation: A combination of two or more different types of topologies.

## Usage

- Each topology has its dedicated folder containing:
  - A detailed explanation of the topology.
  - The diagram representing the topology.
